## 🎨 Creational Design Patterns

****Design patterns*** are like cheat codes for coding problems! <br/>
They’re tried-and-true solutions to common software design challenges,
making your code cleaner, easier to maintain, and more flexible. <br/>
Think of them as blueprints, split into creational, structural, and behavioral categories,
each helping you level up your coding game in different ways.*

### *Creational Design Patterns*

Creational design patterns are like your **personal object factory!** Instead of chaotically creating objects all over
the place, these patterns give you **control** over how and when your objects are born. Think of it as leveling up your
object-creation game! 🛠️✨

### Here's the squad:

1. **🥇 Singleton**  
   The "only one" friend. Ensures a class has just **one instance**, like a VIP who doesn't do duplicates. Exclusive
   access only! 🔑<br/>

2. **☕ Factory Method**  
   Think of it as a **barista** taking your order. You say what type of drink you want, and it whips up the right one —
   without you worrying about the recipe. Easy-peasy!

3. **🏗️ Abstract Factory**  
   Next level barista. It's like a **factory of factories**, creating entire sets of related objects — like picking out
   a full outfit, instead of just shoes. Drip 💧!

4. **🥪 Builder**  
   The **meal-prep master**. Helps you build complex objects step-by-step, like assembling a perfect sandwich 🥪, instead
   of tossing everything together into chaos.

5. **🧬 Prototype**  
   The **clone master**. Instead of starting from scratch, it copies existing objects, like **Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V** but in
   code. Fast and efficient, baby! ⚡

<br/>

*These patterns are your **superpowers** 🦸‍♂️ for handling object creation, keeping your code sleek, clean, and
drama-free! 💥*
